Analysis of the possibility of movement measurement on video recordings of the ICSI procedure using machine learning methods

The aim of this thesis is to analyze and evaluate the possibility of measuring the movement of cellular fluids and needle content during the procedure of intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The scope of work also includes the design and implementation of a tool demonstrating the use of a given solution. The system should use video data and measure motion and events inside the needle containing the sperm, medium and the egg cell.
